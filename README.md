## Wi-Fi security

Wi-Fi network security has evolved considerably over the years:

- WPA was a step forward from WEP.
- WPA2 has become the trusted standard for many years.
- WPA3 now offers the most advanced protection.

### WPA2

Le WPA2, launched in 2004, has become the worldwide norm for Wi-Fi security for more than 10 years. It has replaced the TKIP protocol by a stronger crypting protocol called AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), which is still used nowadays.

### WPA3

Not all machines nowadays are equiped with WPA3.

Modern devices connect using WPA3 for maximum security. Older devices can still connect using WPA2, which ensures compatibility. Mixed mode is essential during this transition period because many smart devices (printers, speakers, TVs, etc.)
do not yet support WPA3. A router set to WPA3 can only prevent these devices from connecting. If a device does not support mixed mode, this can create a serious security hole: users may be forced to downgrade the entire network to WPA2 or disable encryption completely to allow all devices to connect.
